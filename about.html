          Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a showcase of my augmented
          reality project, the culmination of my studies in AR at Lampung
          University. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays
          digital information onto the real world, enhancing our perception of
          reality. In this project, I've explored the potential of AR to create
          immersive and interactive experiences. Dive into this project to see
          how I've applied AR technology and the skills I've developed during my
          academic journey. Thank you for taking the time to explore this
          significant piece of my educational experience.
